# OOP METHODS CHEAT SHEET

1. Instance Method (self)
- Works on object data
- Can access instance variables
- Can access class variables
Syntax:
    def method(self): …

2. Class Method (cls)
- Works on class-level data
- Modifies class variables
- Cannot access object instance directly
Syntax:
    @classmethod
    def method(cls): …

3. Static Method
- Utility/helper function inside class
- Does not use self or cls
- Related logically to class
Syntax:
    @staticmethod
    def method(): …

# When to use what?

Use Instance Method when:
- You want to access/update object attributes

Use Class Method when:
- You want to access/update class attributes
- You need alternative constructors

Use Static Method when:
- You want a helper function inside class
- You don’t need class or object data

🎯 Top OOP Method Interview Questions (With Answers)
1️⃣ What is the difference between instance, class, and static methods?

Answer:

Instance method → works with object data (uses self)

Class method → works with class data (uses cls)

Static method → behaves like a normal function inside class (no self, no cls)

2️⃣ When do you use a class method?

Answer:
Use a class method when you need to:

modify class-level variables

create alternative constructors

keep something related to class, not object

Example:

@classmethod
def set_company(cls, name):
    cls.company = name

3️⃣ Why do static methods exist when we can create a normal function?

Answer:
Static methods keep the function logically inside the class,
but do not need object or class data.

Example: validating email, age, marks, etc.

4️⃣ Can static methods access class or instance variables?

Answer:
No.
Static methods cannot access:

self

cls

They only use the parameters you pass.

5️⃣ Can we call instance methods using the class name?

Answer:
Not directly.
You must create an object first:

obj = Student()
Student.method(obj)

6️⃣ Why do we use cls instead of class name inside class methods?

Answer:
Because:

cls automatically refers to the class, even in inheritance

using class name breaks polymorphism

7️⃣ Why use class attribute instead of instance attribute?

Answer:
Use class attributes when the value is:

same for all objects
Examples: species, company_name, school_name

8️⃣ Can we access class variables through objects?

Answer:
Yes, but modifying through object creates a new instance variable,
it does NOT modify the class variable.

9️⃣ What happens if instance and class variable have same name?

Answer:

Python always checks instance variable first

If not found → checks class variable

🔟 Why do we use @staticmethod in validation functions?

Answer:
Because validation does not require the object or class,
but is still logically related to the class.

Example:

@staticmethod
def validate_marks(m):
    return 0 <= m <= 100
