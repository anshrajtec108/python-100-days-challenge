⭐ 1. What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming = A way to structure code using classes & objects.

Class → Blueprint / template

Object → Actual item created from the class

Real-life example:

Class → Car

Objects → Toyota, BMW, Tesla

A class defines what a car is.
An object is the real car.

⭐ 2. Class and Object (basic syntax)
✅ Example:
class Student:
    pass

s1 = Student()  # object
s2 = Student()  # another object


Nothing happens yet, just structure.

⭐ 3. Constructor (__init__)

Constructor runs automatically when object is created.

Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Ansh", 20)
print(s1.name, s1.age)

Output:
Ansh 20

⭐ 4. Understanding self

Refers to current object.

self.name means this object's name.

If you write:

s1 = Student("Ansh", 20)
s2 = Student("Raj", 18)


s1.name → "Ansh"
s2.name → "Raj"
self differentiates both.

⭐ 5. Instance attributes vs Class attributes
◼ Instance attribute

Different for every object.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   # instance attribute

◼ Class attribute

Same for all objects.

class Student:
    college = "ABC University"  # class attribute

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

s1 = Student("Ansh")
print(s1.college)
